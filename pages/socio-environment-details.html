                    The streamgraphs depict a pronounced non-linear escalation in environmental costs as AI model complexity increases, with a marked surge in resource demand 
                    for models exceeding 1,000 billion parameters. For mid-sized models, energy consumption is predominantly concentrated in the US East (Northern Virginia) region. 
                    In contrast, at the ultra-large scale, the Memphis, Tennessee region accounts for the overwhelming majority of both total energy use and associated carbon emissions.
                    The divergence between the two visualizations further highlights the critical role of regional electricity grid efficiency. Locations characterized by low carbon 
                    intensity, notably France and Finland, exhibit a negligible environmental footprint even as computational demands rise. It is important to note, however, that the 
                    data for France and Finland consist of only a single observation each; consequently, their contribution is effectively infinitesimal when compared with regions 
                    represented by substantially larger numbers of records. The same consideration applies to China, which is represented by only two observations.
                    Overall, this comparison underscores that the sustainability of artificial intelligence systems is shaped not only by algorithmic and hardware efficiency, but 
                    also—crucially—by the geographical placement of data centers and the carbon intensity of the local power grids from which they draw energy.

            <p class="chart-description">
                This chart shows how Americans concerns about job automation have evolved from 2021 to 2025. 
                The data is broken down by different levels of worry, showing the percentage of adults who 
                feel very worried, fairly worried, not very worried, not worried at all, or are unsure.
